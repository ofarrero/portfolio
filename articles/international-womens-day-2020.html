          <p>
            On the 2nd of March 2020, I got the opportunity to celebrate International Women's Day in the Google Dublin offices.
            The event was designed to be an opportunity for female college students to hear about the programmes they can take part in at Google and
            to meet and hear from some of the amazing female Leaders who work to create a more inclusive culture for everyone at Google.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of this event I was asked to be on a panel discussion about the Women Techmakers Scholarship. As a recipient of the scholarship
            I was to discuss the application process as well as the struggles I felt were facing women in STEM who are currently in college. I spoke on the panel
            with three other scholars we spoke about the questions that we asked during our application process, these question included how we got involved in
            tech, to talk about a project we were partcicularly proud of as well as our involvment in projects to get more women involved in STEM. We also had
            a great discussion on imposter syndrome that is prevalent in female STEM students and how we dealt with our own imposter syndrome.

          <p>
            I also got to listen to some amazing female speakers who work at Google. I got to hear how they entered the world of tech and science.
            As women are historically underrepresented in STEM industries and leadership positions within STEM fields so it was exciting for me to
            hear about how these women overcame obstacles that were in their way. In particular I liked a quote that one of the speakers, Jessica McCarthy, shared:
          </p>
          <div class="quote-container">
            <blockquote cite="Marie Curie">
              Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained.
            </blockquote>
          </div>
          <p>
            This quote showed me how important hardwork and belief in oneself is in all walks of life but in particular when you are a woman in STEM. Another speaker, Grainne Sherin, talked about the importance of
            diversity in companies. She said that diversity is about having different people who all took different routes to get to where they are working together. The importance of diversity in a company such
            as Google is invaluable as it allows for increased creativity and growth.
          </p>
          <p>I really enjoyed celebrating International Women's Day in Google. I got to hear from some incredibly inspiring women who are leaders in their field as well as getting to impart some of my own knowledge
          to females in the same position that I am.</p>
