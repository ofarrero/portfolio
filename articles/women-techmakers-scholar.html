              <p>
                In 2020 I was given the honour of being one of the first Women Techmaker Irish University Scholars. This is an award given by Google in honour of Anita Borg.
                Anita Borg was an American Computer scientist who founded the Grace Hopper celecration and believed that the abilty to understand technology should be equally
                available to everyone no matter their gender or background.
              </p>
              <p>
                This scholarship was created to continue on what Anita Borg started. The aim is to encourage gender equality in computing by encouraging young women to
                become leaders and role models within the industry. The scholarship was awarded based on strength of impact on diversity, demonstrated leadership and academic background.
                It is an incredible honour to be recognised for the work that I have done and to be considered a leader and a role model. I hope to continue to encourage women young and
                old to get involved in STEM, in particular in technology and engineering.
